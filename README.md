## Install
To install project dependencies, execute the following steps:
1) Install *virtualenv*: `pip3 install virtualenv`
2) Create a virtual environment (named *venv*) in the project directory: `python3 -m venv venv`
3) Activate *venv*: `source venv/bin/activate`
4) Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can now execute `jupyter notebook` now to create a local Jupyter server.
